## Optimization Breakdown

### ✅ Optimization 1: Extract Progress UI Component (-24 lines)

**Before:** 701 lines (with inline progress UI)
**After:** 677 lines
**Reduction:** -24 lines

**What was done:**
1. Created `ProgressOverviewCard.js` component (40 lines)
2. Extracted progress overview card with 4 steps (passport, travel, accommodation, funds)
3. Replaced 29 lines of inline JSX with 4-line component usage

**Files Created:**
- `/app/components/thailand/ProgressOverviewCard.js` (40 lines)

**Benefits:**
- Reusable progress UI component
- Cleaner screen file
- Easier to test progress UI independently
- Can be used by other country screens

---

### ✅ Optimization 2: Create Fund Management Hook (-50 lines)

**Before:** 677 lines (with inline fund functions)
**After:** 627 lines
**Reduction:** -50 lines

**What was done:**
1. Created `useThailandFundManagement.js` hook (129 lines)
2. Moved 6 fund management functions to hook:
   - `addFund` - Opens modal for new fund item
   - `handleFundItemPress` - Opens modal for editing
   - `handleFundItemModalClose` - Closes modal
   - `handleFundItemUpdate` - Updates existing fund item
   - `handleFundItemCreate` - Creates new fund item
   - `handleFundItemDelete` - Deletes fund item
3. Added `normalizeFundItem` utility in hook
4. Exported from `hooks/thailand/index.js`
5. Initialized hook in screen and removed inline functions

**Files Created:**
- `/app/hooks/thailand/useThailandFundManagement.js` (129 lines)

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/hooks/thailand/index.js` - Added export

**Benefits:**
- Cleaner separation of fund management logic
- Reusable hook for other screens
- Easier to test fund operations
- Better code organization
- All CRUD operations in one place

**Hook Architecture:**
```javascript
useThailandFundManagement({
  formState,
  refreshFundItems,
  debouncedSaveData
})
```

**Returns:**
```javascript
{
  addFund,
  handleFundItemPress,
  handleFundItemModalClose,
  handleFundItemUpdate,
  handleFundItemCreate,
  handleFundItemDelete
}
```

---

### ✅ Optimization 3: Remove Debug Functions (-27 lines)

**Before:** 627 lines (with debug function)
**After:** 600 lines
**Reduction:** -27 lines (24 lines function + 1 line import + 2 blank lines)

**What was done:**
1. Removed unused `clearUserData` debug function (24 lines)
2. Removed unused `SecureStorageService` import
3. Function was never called and had undefined references

**Why removed instead of moved:**
- Function was not being used anywhere
- Had undefined function references (`setDob`, `setPassportNo`, etc.)
- Not needed for production code
- Can be recreated properly if needed in future

**Removed:**
```javascript
const clearUserData = async () => {
  // 24 lines of unused debug code
};
```

**Benefits:**
- Cleaner production code
- Removed unused imports
- No dead code in screen file

## Comparison: Malaysia vs Thailand (Final)

| Metric | Malaysia | Thailand | Ratio | Status |
|--------|----------|----------|-------|--------|
| **Screen lines** | 423 | 600 | 1.42x | ✅ Acceptable |
| **Styles lines** | 55 | 254 | 4.62x | ✅ More complex UI |
| **Total** | 478 | 854 | 1.79x | ✅ Justified |
| **Number of hooks** | 3 | 5 | - | 🏆 Thailand |
| **Architecture** | A+ | A+ | - | 🤝 TIE |

**Note:** Thailand total includes screen (600) + styles (254) = 854 lines

---

## Why Thailand is Still Larger (Justified ✅)

Thailand remains 1.79x larger than Malaysia, which is fully justified by:

### 1. More Complex Features (+75% more fields)
- **Location Cascade:** Province → District → SubDistrict (Malaysia doesn't have this)
- **Photo Uploads:** 2 types (flight ticket, hotel reservation)
- **Transit Logic:** Complex passenger handling
- **Additional Fields:** Visa, boarding country, recent stay

### 2. More Sophisticated Hooks
- **5 custom hooks** vs Malaysia's 3
- **Fund management hook** (Thailand only)
- **Location cascade hook** (Thailand only)
- More complex persistence and validation

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- **Progress tracking UI** with 4 steps and encouragement
- **4 save status states** with visual feedback
- **Cultural tips** for border crossing
- **More detailed error messages**

### 4. More Complex Styles
- **254 lines of styles** vs Malaysia's 55
- Progress UI styling (steps, badges, animations)
- 4 save status variants
- More interactive elements
