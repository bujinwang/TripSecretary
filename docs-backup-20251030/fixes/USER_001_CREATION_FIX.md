# User_001 Creation Fix

## Problem
The app was using `user_001` as a hardcoded user ID throughout the codebase, but there was no logic to actually create this user record in the Users table. This caused issues when the app tried to perform operations that required a valid user record.

## Root Cause
- The app assumes `user_001` exists in the Users table
- No user creation logic was implemented during app initialization
- PassportDataService.initialize() was called but didn't ensure the user record existed

## Solution
Added user creation logic to ensure `user_001` record exists when the app initializes:

### 1. Added `ensureUser` method to SecureStorageService
```javascript
/**
 * Ensure a user record exists in the users table
 * Creates the user if it doesn't exist
 * @param {string} userId - User ID to ensure exists
 * @returns {Promise<void>}
 */
async ensureUser(userId) {
  try {
    await this.ensureInitialized();

    // Check if user already exists
    const existingUser = await this.modernDb.getFirstAsync(
      'SELECT id FROM users WHERE id = ?',
      [userId]
    );

    if (!existingUser) {
      // Create the user record
      const now = new Date().toISOString();
      await this.modernDb.runAsync(
        'INSERT INTO users (id, created_at, updated_at) VALUES (?, ?, ?)',
        [userId, now, now]
      );
      console.log(`✅ Created user record for: ${userId}`);
    } else {
      console.log(`✅ User record already exists for: ${userId}`);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to ensure user exists:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### 2. Updated PassportDataService.initialize() to call ensureUser
```javascript
// Initialize SecureStorageService (ensures database schema exists)
try {
  await SecureStorageService.initialize(userId);
  
  // Ensure user record exists in the database
  await SecureStorageService.ensureUser(userId);
} catch (initError) {
  // ... error handling
}
```

## Files Modified
- `app/services/security/SecureStorageService.js` - Added `ensureUser` method
- `app/services/data/PassportDataService.js` - Updated `initialize` method to call `ensureUser`

## Testing
Created test scripts to verify the fix:
- `scripts/test-user-creation.js` - Tests if user_001 record exists
- `scripts/test-ensure-user.js` - Simulates the ensureUser functionality

### Test Results
```
✅ SUCCESS: user_001 record exists and is ready for use!
   ID: user_001

   Updated: 2025-10-23T03:08:11.965Z
```

## Impact
- ✅ Fixes the "no record is created for user_001 in Users table" issue
- ✅ Ensures user record exists before any operations that require it
- ✅ Idempotent - safe to call multiple times
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Automatic - happens during normal app initialization

## Initialization Flow
```
App Starts
    ↓
HomeScreen/ThailandTravelInfoScreen loads
    ↓
PassportDataService.initialize('user_001')
    ↓
SecureStorageService.initialize('user_001')
    ↓
SecureStorageService.ensureUser('user_001') ← NEW!
    ↓
User record created if doesn't exist
    ↓
App continues normally
```

## Future Considerations
- This fix handles the immediate issue with `user_001`
- For production, consider implementing proper user authentication
- The hardcoded `user_001` should eventually be replaced with dynamic user IDs
- Consider adding user management features (create, update, delete users)
