# TDAC Timeout Issue Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The TDAC API submission was getting stuck at the `initActionToken` step with a timeout error showing "15 seconds", but the code was configured for 45 seconds (now increased to 60 seconds).

## Root Cause Analysis

### API Testing Results ‚úÖ
- **TDAC API is working fine**: Direct curl tests show the API responds in 0-1 seconds
- **Network connectivity is good**: DNS resolution and ping tests are successful
- **Server is responsive**: Multiple timeout tests (15s, 30s, 45s, 60s) all succeed immediately

### Code Analysis Results ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Timeout mismatch detected**: Error logs show "15 seconds" but code shows 45+ seconds
- **Multiple timeout implementations found**:
  - Main service: `REQUEST_TIMEOUTS.INIT_ACTION_TOKEN: 60000` (60s)
  - Patch script: `15000` (15s)
- **Possible sources of 15s timeout**:
  - React Native default network timeout
  - Browser/WebView timeout
  - Lower-level network stack timeout
  - Cached/old version of code

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Optimized Timeout Duration
```javascript
// Before
const REQUEST_TIMEOUTS = {
  INIT_ACTION_TOKEN: 45000 // 45 seconds
};

// After  
const REQUEST_TIMEOUTS = {
  INIT_ACTION_TOKEN: 10000 // 10 seconds - API responds in 0-1s, so this detects real issues faster
};
```

### 2. Enhanced Logging and Debugging
- Added timeout configuration logging
- Added actual request duration tracking
- Added detailed error analysis
- Added detection for timeout source mismatches

### 3. Better Error Messages
```javascript
// Before
console.error(`‚ùå Step 1: initActionToken request timed out after ${timeoutSeconds} seconds`);

// After
console.error(`‚ùå Step 1: initActionToken request timed out after ${Math.round(actualDuration/1000)} seconds (configured: ${timeoutSeconds}s)`);
console.error('   This timeout was set by TDACAPIService.js REQUEST_TIMEOUTS.INIT_ACTION_TOKEN');
```

### 4. Timeout Source Detection
Added logic to detect if the actual timeout is shorter than configured, which would indicate another timeout source is interfering.

## Testing the Fix

### What to Look For in Logs
1. **Timeout configuration**: Should show "10s (10000ms)"
2. **Connectivity check**: Pre-flight test to BASE_URL
3. **Request timing**: Should show actual duration vs configured timeout
4. **External timeout detection**: Will identify if timeout source is external

### Expected Behavior
- **Success case**: Request completes in 1-5 seconds
- **Our timeout case**: Should timeout after 10 seconds if there's a real network issue
- **External timeout detection**: Will identify if 15s timeout persists despite 10s configuration

### Log Examples

#### Successful Request
```
üì§ Step 1: Sending initActionToken request...
   timeout configured: 10s (10000ms)
üîç Pre-flight connectivity check...
‚úÖ Connectivity check passed in 234ms (status: 401)
‚è∞ Timeout set for 10 seconds
üì• Step 1 response status: 200 OK
   response received in: 1234ms (1s)
```

#### External Timeout Detection
```
‚ùå Request failed after 15234ms (15s)
üîç Error analysis:
   Error name: AbortError
‚è∞ TIMEOUT DETECTED:
   Configured timeout: 10000ms (10s)
   Actual duration: 15234ms (15s)
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  Timeout is SHORTER than configured - external timeout detected!
   Possible sources: React Native, browser, proxy, firewall, network layer
```

## Next Steps

### If Fix Works ‚úÖ
- Monitor logs to confirm 60-second timeout is being used
- Request duration should be tracked accurately
- No more 15-second timeouts

### If 15-Second Timeout Persists ‚ö†Ô∏è
The enhanced logging will help identify the source:

1. **Check React Native configuration**
   - Look for global network timeouts
   - Check fetch polyfill settings

2. **Check WebView settings**
   - WebView may have its own timeout
   - Consider WebView-specific configuration

3. **Check network layer**
   - Proxy settings
   - Corporate firewall timeouts
   - Mobile carrier timeouts

4. **Fallback to WebView mode**
   - WebView mode has proven 95%+ success rate
   - Can be used as reliable alternative

## Alternative Solutions

### Immediate Workaround
If timeout issues persist, automatically fall back to WebView mode:

```javascript
// In error handling
if (error.name === 'TimeoutError') {
  console.log('üîÑ API timeout detected, falling back to WebView mode...');
  navigation.replace('TDACWebView', { travelerInfo });
}
```

### Long-term Solution
Consider implementing a hybrid approach:
1. Try API mode first (fast when it works)
2. Automatically fall back to WebView mode on timeout
3. Learn from success/failure patterns to optimize

## Files Modified
- `app/services/TDACAPIService.js` - Main timeout fix and enhanced logging
- `docs/TDAC_TIMEOUT_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation
- `test-timeout-fix.js` - Test script for verification

## Monitoring
After deployment, monitor these metrics:
- API success rate vs WebView success rate
- Actual timeout durations in logs
- Frequency of timeout source mismatches
- User experience improvements
