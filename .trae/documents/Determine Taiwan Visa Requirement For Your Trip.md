## What I Found
- Taiwan uses a visa‑exempt program for many passports with stays up to 90, 30 or 14 days. Requirements include passport validity (generally 6 months; USA and Japan valid for intended stay), and onward/return ticket (Source: https://www.boca.gov.tw/cp-149-4486-7785a-2.html).
- 90‑day visa‑exempt includes most EU/Schengen countries, UK, US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, etc. 30‑day includes Malaysia, Singapore and several others; 14‑day currently applies to Thailand, Brunei, and the Philippines through July 31, 2026 (Source: https://www.boca.gov.tw/cp-149-4486-7785a-2.html).
- If visa‑required, Taiwan supports eVisa for select countries; others may need an e‑code via an event sponsor or apply at an ROC mission (summary: https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2025/visa/; always verify against BOCA).
- Special entry: Hong Kong/Macau use an Entry Permit via Taiwan NIA; PRC (Mainland China) requires separate permits and processes.

## Plan To Finalize
1. Identify your passport country, trip length, and purpose (tourism/business/family).
2. Cross‑check directly against BOCA’s visa‑exempt table and note any special validity exceptions.
3. If visa‑required, choose path (eVisa vs. paper visa) and list documents and timing.
4. Provide a concise, passport‑specific checklist and update your trip card status from "To be confirmed" to the correct requirement note after your approval.

## Deliverables After Approval
- A one‑page, passport‑specific checklist with links to the exact BOCA page.
- Clear go/no‑go summary for visa‑exempt vs. eVisa/paper visa, with deadlines.
- Suggested wording for your app card (e.g., "Visa‑exempt, 90 days; onward ticket required").
