# Final Fix - Foreign Key Reference Error

## The Real Problem

After all previous fixes, the app was still failing with:
```
Failed to create tables: no such column: user_id
```

## Root Cause

The `digital_arrival_cards` table had an **incorrect foreign key reference**:

```sql
-- WRONG (referencing non-existent table)
FOREIGN KEY (entry_info_id) REFERENCES "entry_info_old"(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
```

This was left over from a previous migration that renamed `entry_info` to `entry_info_old` temporarily. When the migration failed or was interrupted, the foreign key was never updated to point back to the correct table.

## Impact

- ❌ App failed to initialize SecureStorageService
- ❌ Database schema validation failed
- ❌ Foreign key constraints couldn't be enforced
- ❌ HomeScreen couldn't load data

## The Fix

**Rebuilt digital_arrival_cards table** with correct foreign key:

```sql
-- CORRECT
FOREIGN KEY (entry_info_id) REFERENCES entry_info(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
```

### Fix Steps:

1. Backup existing data to temp table
2. Drop old table with wrong foreign key
3. Recreate table with correct foreign key
4. Restore data from backup
5. Recreate trigger and indexes

**Result**: ✅ All data preserved, foreign key corrected

## Verification

```sql
-- Check DAC record
dac_thailand_0836c73_success|entry_1761348094096_5kg7bla7e|TDAC|success|0836C73

-- Verify foreign key
FOREIGN KEY (entry_info_id) REFERENCES entry_info(id) ON DELETE CASCADE ✅
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ✅
```

## All Fixes Applied (Summary)

### 1. EntryInfoService.js
- Added SecureStorageService initialization

### 2. BackgroundJobService.js
- Added graceful error handling for non-critical background tasks

### 3. DatabaseSchema.js
- Fixed snapshots migration to cleanup orphaned tables
- Added schema validation before data migration

### 4. Database Cleanup
- Removed `snapshots_old` table
- Removed `entry_info_old` table
- Fixed `digital_arrival_cards` foreign key

### 5. Thailand destination_id
- Fixed 8 hardcoded 'thailand' → 'th' occurrences

## Files Modified (Total: 3)

1. `app/services/EntryInfoService.js`
2. `app/services/background/BackgroundJobService.js`
3. `app/services/security/schema/DatabaseSchema.js`

## Database Operations

1. Cleaned orphaned tables
2. Fixed foreign key references
3. Rebuilt Thailand submission records
4. Verified data integrity

## Testing Checklist

Now restart the app and verify:

### ✅ No Errors
- [ ] No "no such column: user_id" error
- [ ] No "no such table: entry_info_old" error
- [ ] No "Failed to create tables" error
- [ ] No migration errors

### ✅ Successful Initialization
- [ ] Console shows: "✅ Database schema v2.0 created successfully"
- [ ] Console shows: "BackgroundJobService started successfully"
- [ ] No SecureStorageService initialization errors

### ✅ HomeScreen Display
- [ ] Section 1 "我的行程": Thailand (已提交, ARR: 0836C73)
- [ ] Section 2 "填写中": Hong Kong (95%完成)
- [ ] No console errors

### ✅ Data Integrity
- [ ] Thailand DAC record preserved
- [ ] Entry info records intact
- [ ] Foreign keys valid

## Next Steps

```bash
# Clear cache and restart
npx expo start --clear
```

Expected: **App loads successfully with no errors** ✨

## Prevention

To prevent this in future migrations:

1. **Always validate foreign keys** after table renames
2. **Use transactions** for atomic operations
3. **Clean up temp tables** immediately after migration
4. **Test migrations** with foreign key constraints enabled
5. **Log foreign key references** before and after migrations
