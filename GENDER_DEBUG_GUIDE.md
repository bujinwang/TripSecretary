# Gender Selection Debug Guide

## Issue
Gender selection is not showing as selected (highlighted) when reopening the modal, even though it was saved.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be related to old saved data in storage that doesn't match the current data structure.

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Console Logs
When you open the gender modal, check the console for these logs:
```
handleStartEdit called with type: personal field: gender
Current personalInfo: {gender: "MALE", ...}
Setting editingContext with type: personal field.key: gender currentValue: MALE
Rendering gender modal - editValue: MALE personalInfo.gender: MALE
renderGenderOptions - editValue: MALE personalInfo.gender: MALE
Option MALE: editValue="MALE", isActive=true
Option FEMALE: editValue="MALE", isActive=false
Option UNDEFINED: editValue="MALE", isActive=false
```

If `editValue` is empty or doesn't match the expected value, that's the problem.

### 2. Check Saved Data
Look for this log on app start:
```
Loading saved personalInfo: {...}
Saved gender value: MALE
Merged personalInfo: {...}
Final gender value: MALE
```

If the saved data doesn't have a `gender` field, or it's undefined, that's the issue.

### 3. Clear Saved Data
Two ways to clear the storage:

#### Option A: Use the UI Button
1. Scroll down in the Profile screen
2. Find "Settings & Help" section
3. Tap "Clear Saved Data" (üóëÔ∏è icon)
4. Confirm the alert

#### Option B: Use Console
Run this command in the console:
```javascript
global.clearProfileStorage()
```

### 4. Test Again
After clearing storage:
1. Close and reopen the app
2. Open the gender field
3. Select "Male" (Áî∑ÊÄß)
4. Close the modal
5. Reopen the gender field
6. The "Male" button should now be highlighted

## Data Migration

The code now includes automatic migration for old data formats:
- If `name` field is missing but `nameEn` exists, it converts it
- If `nameEn` is "ZHANG WEI" (space-separated), it converts to "ZHANG, WEI" (comma-separated)
- Missing fields are filled with defaults

## Expected Behavior

When working correctly:
1. Opening gender modal shows current selection highlighted
2. Selecting a gender saves immediately
3. Modal closes after 0.5 seconds
4. Reopening shows the saved selection highlighted
5. Data persists across app restarts

## Common Issues

### Issue: Gender not highlighted
**Cause**: `editValue` doesn't match the saved value
**Solution**: Check console logs to see what `editValue` is set to

### Issue: Data not persisting
**Cause**: Storage save/load failing
**Solution**: Check for error logs in console

### Issue: Old data format
**Cause**: Data saved before migration code was added
**Solution**: Clear storage and start fresh
