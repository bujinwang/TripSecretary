# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the issue where certain form fields in travel information screens are initialized with default values and automatically saved to the database without explicit user interaction. Currently, three fields (travel purpose, accommodation type, and boarding country) are hard-coded with default values that get persisted even when users haven't made conscious choices about these fields.

## Glossary

- **Travel_Info_System**: The system that manages travel information entry and persistence for various destinations
- **User_Interaction_Tracker**: A component that tracks whether a user has explicitly interacted with form fields
- **Field_State_Manager**: The system that manages the state of form fields and determines when they should be saved
- **Auto_Save_System**: The debounced save mechanism that persists form data to secure storage

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a traveler filling out travel information, I want only the fields I've explicitly filled or selected to be saved, so that I don't have unwanted default values persisted in my profile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens a travel information screen, THE Travel_Info_System SHALL initialize form fields with empty values instead of hard-coded defaults
2. WHEN a user interacts with a form field for the first time, THE User_Interaction_Tracker SHALL mark that field as user-modified
3. WHEN the Auto_Save_System triggers, THE Field_State_Manager SHALL only save fields that have been marked as user-modified
4. WHEN a user loads previously saved data, THE Travel_Info_System SHALL display the actual saved values without applying new defaults
5. WHERE a field has smart defaults available, THE Travel_Info_System SHALL display these as placeholder text or suggestions rather than pre-filled values

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a traveler, I want to see helpful suggestions for common travel scenarios, so that I can quickly select appropriate values without having them forced upon me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user focuses on the travel purpose field, THE Travel_Info_System SHALL display common purpose options as suggestions
2. WHEN a user focuses on the accommodation type field, THE Travel_Info_System SHALL display common accommodation types as suggestions  
3. WHEN a user focuses on the boarding country field, THE Travel_Info_System SHALL suggest the passport nationality as the first option
4. WHEN a user selects a suggested value, THE User_Interaction_Tracker SHALL mark the field as user-modified
5. WHILE displaying suggestions, THE Travel_Info_System SHALL not pre-select any option automatically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent mechanism to track user interactions across all form fields, so that the save behavior is predictable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE User_Interaction_Tracker SHALL provide a uniform interface for tracking field interactions across all travel information screens
2. WHEN a field value changes through user interaction, THE User_Interaction_Tracker SHALL record the interaction timestamp
3. WHEN the component unmounts or navigation occurs, THE User_Interaction_Tracker SHALL persist interaction state to prevent data loss
4. THE Field_State_Manager SHALL distinguish between programmatic value changes and user-initiated changes
5. WHERE existing saved data exists, THE User_Interaction_Tracker SHALL mark those fields as user-modified to preserve existing behavior

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a traveler with existing saved data, I want my previously entered information to remain intact, so that this fix doesn't disrupt my existing travel preparations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading existing travel information, THE Travel_Info_System SHALL preserve all previously saved field values
2. WHEN existing data is loaded, THE User_Interaction_Tracker SHALL mark all populated fields as user-modified
3. THE Field_State_Manager SHALL continue to save updates to fields that contain existing data
4. WHERE no existing data exists for a field, THE Travel_Info_System SHALL treat the field as unmodified until user interaction occurs
5. THE Auto_Save_System SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing data structures

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a traveler, I want the completion progress indicators to accurately reflect my actual input, so that I can understand what information I still need to provide.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Travel_Info_System SHALL calculate completion percentages based only on user-modified fields
2. WHEN displaying field counts in section headers, THE Travel_Info_System SHALL count only fields with user-provided values
3. WHEN a field has a default suggestion but no user interaction, THE Travel_Info_System SHALL treat it as incomplete
4. THE Travel_Info_System SHALL update completion metrics immediately when a user interacts with a field
5. WHERE a field becomes user-modified, THE Travel_Info_System SHALL include it in completion calculations going forward
