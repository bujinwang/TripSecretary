# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the ProfileScreen to allow users to create, view, edit, and delete fund items directly within the Profile interface. Currently, users can only view existing fund items in Profile and must navigate to the ThailandTravelInfo screen to add new items. This creates an inconsistent user experience since passport and personal data can be fully managed in Profile. This enhancement will centralize all user data management in one location and remove the dependency on destination-specific screens for managing centralized data.

## Glossary

- **ProfileScreen**: The main user profile interface where users manage their passport, personal information, and fund items
- **FundItem**: A financial proof record (cash, bank card, document, etc.) stored in the centralized database
- **FundItemDetailModal**: A modal component that displays and allows editing of fund item details
- **PassportDataService**: The centralized service for managing all user data including fund items
- **Funding Section**: The collapsible section in ProfileScreen that displays the user's fund items list
