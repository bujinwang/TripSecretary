# TDAC Debug Mode Requirements

## Introduction

This feature adds debugging capabilities to the TDAC (Thailand Digital Arrival Card) submission flow to help developers verify that form fields are being filled correctly and troubleshoot submission issues.

## Glossary

- **TDAC_System**: The Thailand Digital Arrival Card web-based system accessed through WebView
- **Debug_Mode**: A development-only mode that enables form visibility and manual control
- **Form_Data**: The user information that gets auto-filled into TDAC form fields
- **Auto_Fill_Process**: The JavaScript injection that populates form fields automatically
- **Navigation_Control**: The ability to prevent automatic page transitions during debugging

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to enable debug mode for TDAC submissions, so that I can verify form data accuracy during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is running in development mode, THE TDAC_System SHALL provide a debug mode toggle option
2. WHEN debug mode is enabled, THE TDAC_System SHALL make the form/page visible instead of auto-submitting
3. WHEN debug mode is active, THE TDAC_System SHALL log detailed form data to the console
4. WHEN debug mode is enabled, THE TDAC_System SHALL prevent automatic navigation to the next page
5. WHERE debug mode is active, THE TDAC_System SHALL allow manual progression through the form steps

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see detailed logging of form data, so that I can verify the correct information is being submitted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN form fields are being auto-filled, THE TDAC_System SHALL log each field name and value to the console
2. WHEN auto-fill attempts fail, THE TDAC_System SHALL log the failure reason and attempted search terms
3. WHEN form submission is triggered, THE TDAC_System SHALL log the complete form data payload
4. WHEN debug mode is active, THE TDAC_System SHALL display form data in a readable format on screen
5. THE TDAC_System SHALL include timestamps in all debug log entries

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want manual control over form progression, so that I can inspect each step before proceeding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debug mode is enabled, THE TDAC_System SHALL disable automatic "Continue" button clicking
2. WHEN a form step is completed, THE TDAC_System SHALL wait for manual confirmation before proceeding
3. WHEN debug mode is active, THE TDAC_System SHALL provide visual indicators showing which fields were successfully filled
4. WHEN manual progression is required, THE TDAC_System SHALL display clear instructions to the developer
5. THE TDAC_System SHALL allow developers to manually trigger auto-fill for individual fields during debugging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see form validation status, so that I can identify and fix data formatting issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN form fields are populated, THE TDAC_System SHALL validate field formats and log any issues
2. WHEN validation errors occur, THE TDAC_System SHALL highlight problematic fields visually
3. WHEN debug mode is active, THE TDAC_System SHALL show field matching success/failure status
4. THE TDAC_System SHALL provide suggestions for fixing common field matching issues
5. WHEN form submission fails, THE TDAC_System SHALL capture and log the error details
