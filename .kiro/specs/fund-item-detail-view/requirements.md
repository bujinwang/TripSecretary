# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the fund item management experience in the ProfileScreen by providing a detailed view when users tap on individual fund items. Currently, tapping a fund item navigates to the ThailandTravelInfo screen for general fund management. This feature will introduce a dedicated detail modal that allows users to view, edit, and delete specific fund items directly from the profile.
