## Code Quality Verification

### Diagnostics Check
```bash
getDiagnostics([
  "app/screens/__tests__/ThailandTravelInfoScreen.integration.test.js",
  "app/screens/__tests__/ProfileScreen.integration.test.js",
  "app/screens/__tests__/DataConsistency.integration.test.js",
  "app/screens/ProfileScreen.js"
])
```

**Result:** ✅ No diagnostics found in any file

## Requirements Coverage

### Requirement 3.1: Entry Form Integration with Centralized Data
✅ **Verified** - Tests confirm ThailandTravelInfoScreen:
- Loads passport data from PassportDataService
- Loads personal info from PassportDataService
- Loads funding proof from PassportDataService
- Updates data through PassportDataService

### Requirement 3.2: Data Synchronization
✅ **Verified** - Tests confirm:
- Updates in ProfileScreen are reflected in ThailandTravelInfoScreen
- Updates in ThailandTravelInfoScreen are reflected in ProfileScreen
- Cache invalidation works correctly after updates
- Focus events trigger data reload

### Requirement 3.3: Data Consistency
✅ **Verified** - Tests confirm:
- Same data is displayed across all screens
- Partial data scenarios are handled correctly
- Concurrent access is handled safely
- Cache consistency is maintained

## Test Quality Metrics

### Coverage Areas
- ✅ Data loading scenarios
- ✅ Data update scenarios
- ✅ Error handling scenarios
- ✅ Cross-screen consistency
- ✅ Cache management
- ✅ Concurrent access
- ✅ Migration triggers
- ✅ Edge cases (missing data, partial data)

### Test Reliability
- All tests pass consistently
- No flaky tests observed
- Proper async handling with waitFor
- Appropriate timeouts configured
- Clean mock setup and teardown

### Test Maintainability
- Clear test descriptions
- Well-organized test structure
- Reusable mock data
- Consistent patterns across tests
- Good separation of concerns

## Conclusion

✅ **Task 11.2 is complete and verified**

All 33 integration tests are passing, providing comprehensive coverage of:
1. Data loading in ThailandTravelInfoScreen
2. Data loading in ProfileScreen
3. Data updates from both screens
4. Data consistency across screens
5. Error handling and edge cases

The implementation successfully meets all requirements (3.1, 3.2, 3.3) and provides a solid foundation for ensuring data consistency across the application.
