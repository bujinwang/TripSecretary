## Key Implementation Details

### Test Infrastructure Setup

1. **Jest Configuration Updates**
   - Added expo modules to transformIgnorePatterns
   - Configured proper module transformation for React Native

2. **Mock Setup**
   - Mocked PassportDataService for all tests
   - Mocked LocaleContext with useTranslation support
   - Mocked expo-image-picker and expo-file-system
   - Added navigation.addListener mock for focus events

3. **Bug Fixes**
   - Fixed ProfileScreen null pointer issue with editingContext
   - Added optional chaining for safe property access
   - Ensured proper userId handling ('default_user')

### Test Patterns Used

1. **Service Integration Testing**
   - Verify PassportDataService methods are called correctly
   - Test data flow from service to UI
   - Validate error handling

2. **Cross-Screen Consistency**
   - Test data synchronization between screens
   - Verify cache invalidation on updates
   - Test concurrent access scenarios

3. **Error Handling**
   - Test graceful degradation on service failures
   - Verify screens render without crashing
   - Test error logging

## Files Modified

### Test Files Created/Updated
- `app/screens/__tests__/ThailandTravelInfoScreen.integration.test.js` - 9 tests
- `app/screens/__tests__/ProfileScreen.integration.test.js` - 13 tests
- `app/screens/__tests__/DataConsistency.integration.test.js` - 11 tests

### Configuration Files Updated
- `jest.config.js` - Added expo modules to transform patterns
- `jest.setup.js` - Added mocks for expo-image-picker and expo-file-system

### Bug Fixes
- `app/screens/ProfileScreen.js` - Fixed null pointer issue with editingContext

## Requirements Verified

✅ **Requirement 3.1**: Entry Form Integration with Centralized Data
- Tests verify ThailandTravelInfoScreen loads data from PassportDataService
- Tests verify data updates are persisted through the service

✅ **Requirement 3.2**: Data Synchronization
- Tests verify updates in one screen are reflected in another
- Tests verify cache invalidation works correctly

✅ **Requirement 3.3**: Data Consistency
- Tests verify same data is shown across all screens
- Tests verify concurrent access is handled safely
- Tests verify partial data scenarios work correctly

## Next Steps

Task 11.2 is complete. The integration tests provide comprehensive coverage of:
- Data loading in both screens
- Data updates through PassportDataService
- Cross-screen data consistency
- Error handling and edge cases

All tests are passing and the implementation meets the requirements.
