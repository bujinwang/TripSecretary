# Task 8: Update ProfileScreen - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully updated ProfileScreen to use PassportDataService as the centralized data management layer, replacing direct SecureStorageService calls with the unified data service.

## Changes Made

### 8.1 Replace AsyncStorage with PassportDataService ✅
- **Import Changes**: Replaced `SecureStorageService` import with `PassportDataService`
- **Load Function**: Updated `loadSavedData()` to use `PassportDataService.getAllUserData(userId)`
- **Clear Storage**: Updated `handleClearStorage()` to use `PassportDataService.clearCache()`
- **Removed**: Old `useEffect` hooks that saved data directly to SecureStorageService

### 8.2 Update Passport Data Loading ✅
- **Field Mapping**: Properly mapped passport model fields to component state:
  - `fullName` → `name` and `nameEn`
  - `passportNumber` → `passportNo`
  - `expiryDate` → `expiry`
  - `issueDate` → `issueDate`
  - `issuePlace` → `issuePlace`
  - `nationality` → `nationality`
- **Gender Field**: Included gender field from passport data
- **Date of Birth**: Loaded dateOfBirth from passport data

### 8.3 Update Personal Info Loading ✅
- **Field Mapping**: Properly mapped personal info model fields to component state:
  - `phoneNumber` → `phone`
  - `email` → `email`
  - `occupation` → `occupation`
  - `provinceCity` → `provinceCity`
  - `countryRegion` → `countryRegion`
- **Gender Integration**: Gender is loaded from passport data (stored in passport model)
- **Date of Birth Integration**: Date of birth is loaded from passport data

### 8.4 Update Funding Proof Loading ✅
- **Field Mapping**: Properly mapped funding proof model fields to component state:
  - `cashAmount` → `cashAmount`
  - `bankCards` → `bankCards`
  - `supportingDocs` → `supportingDocs`
- **Graceful Handling**: Handles missing funding proof data gracefully

### 8.5 Update Data Saving Logic ✅
- **handleSaveEdit()**: Updated to save data through PassportDataService
  - Personal info updates use `PassportDataService.updatePersonalInfo()`
  - Passport updates use `PassportDataService.updatePassport()`
  - Funding proof updates use `PassportDataService.updateFundingProof()`
  - Gender and dateOfBirth updates are saved to passport model
- **handleAutoSave()**: Updated to auto-save through PassportDataService with debouncing
- **handleGenderSelect()**: Updated to save gender to passport model
- **handleDateInputChange()**: Updated to save date of birth to passport model
- **Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks with user-friendly error messages

### 8.6 Add Migration Trigger on First Load ✅
- **Migration Check**: Added migration trigger in `loadSavedData()`
- **Non-Fatal**: Migration errors are logged but don't prevent app from loading
- **Automatic**: Migration happens automatically on first load

## Key Implementation Details

### User ID Management
- Currently using hardcoded `'default_user'` as userId
- In production, this should come from authentication context
- Consistent userId used across all PassportDataService calls

### Field Mapping Strategy
The component maintains its own state structure for UI purposes, but maps to the centralized data models when saving/loading:

**Component State → Model Fields:**
- `passportData.name` → `passport.fullName`
- `passportData.passportNo` → `passport.passportNumber`
- `personalInfo.phone` → `personalInfo.phoneNumber`
- `personalInfo.gender` → `passport.gender`
- `personalInfo.dateOfBirth` → `passport.dateOfBirth`

### Data Flow
1. **Load**: PassportDataService → Model → Component State
2. **Save**: Component State → Model → PassportDataService → SQLite
3. **Migration**: AsyncStorage → PassportDataService → SQLite (one-time)

### Error Handling
- All async operations wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Migration errors are non-fatal and logged
- Save errors show user-friendly alerts
- Graceful degradation if data doesn't exist

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **Load Test**: Open ProfileScreen and verify all data loads correctly
2. **Save Test**: Edit each field type and verify data persists
3. **Gender Test**: Select different gender options and verify they save
4. **Date Test**: Enter date of birth and verify validation and saving
5. **Migration Test**: Clear app data and verify migration from AsyncStorage works
6. **Clear Test**: Use "Clear Saved Data" and verify it clears cache

### Edge Cases to Test
- Empty/missing data in database
- Invalid data formats
- Concurrent edits
- Network/storage failures
- Migration with partial data

## Requirements Coverage

### Requirement 2.1 ✅
"WHEN a user opens the Profile screen THEN the system SHALL display current passport data from the centralized table"
- Implemented via `PassportDataService.getAllUserData()` in `loadSavedData()`

### Requirement 2.2 ✅
"WHEN a user edits passport fields in the Profile screen THEN the system SHALL validate the data before saving"
- Validation exists for date of birth in `validateDateOfBirth()`
- Gender validation through controlled selection

### Requirement 2.3 ✅
"WHEN passport data is successfully updated in Profile THEN the system SHALL persist changes to the centralized SQLite table"
- Implemented via `PassportDataService.updatePassport()` in save handlers

### Requirement 2.4 ✅
"WHEN a user returns to any entry form after updating Profile THEN the system SHALL display the updated passport data"
- Data is centralized, so updates in Profile are immediately available to other screens

### Requirement 7.3 ✅
"WHEN a user navigates to any entry form THEN the system SHALL load personal information from the centralized table"
- Personal info loaded via `PassportDataService.getPersonalInfo()`

### Requirement 7.4 ✅
"WHEN a user updates personal information in the Profile screen THEN the system SHALL update the centralized table"
- Implemented via `PassportDataService.updatePersonalInfo()` in save handlers

### Requirement 8.3 ✅
"WHEN a user navigates to any entry form THEN the system SHALL load funding proof from the centralized table"
- Funding proof loaded via `PassportDataService.getFundingProof()`

### Requirement 8.4 ✅
"WHEN a user updates funding proof in the Profile screen THEN the system SHALL update the centralized table"
- Implemented via `PassportDataService.updateFundingProof()` in save handlers

### Requirement 4.1 ✅
"WHEN the app detects existing passport data in AsyncStorage THEN the system SHALL migrate it to the centralized SQLite table"
- Migration triggered via `PassportDataService.migrateFromAsyncStorage()` on first load

### Requirement 4.2 ✅
"WHEN migration occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing passport fields without data loss"
- Migration logic in PassportDataService preserves all fields

## Files Modified
- `app/screens/ProfileScreen.js` - Complete refactor to use PassportDataService

## Next Steps
1. Test ProfileScreen thoroughly with various data scenarios
2. Verify data consistency between ProfileScreen and ThailandTravelInfoScreen
3. Consider adding loading indicators during data operations
4. Consider adding success notifications for save operations
5. Move to next task in the implementation plan

## Notes
- All sub-tasks completed successfully
- No breaking changes to UI/UX
- Backward compatible through migration logic
- Ready for integration testing with other screens
