# Passport Data Centralization Feature - COMPLETE ✅

## Executive Summary

The **Passport Data Centralization** feature has been successfully completed. All 12 tasks and 40+ subtasks have been implemented, tested, documented, and verified. The feature is production-ready and provides a robust, centralized data management system for user information in the 入境通 (Entry Assistant) app.

## Feature Overview

### Problem Solved
**Before:** User data (passport, personal info, funding proof) was duplicated and managed separately across different screens, leading to:
- Data inconsistency
- Redundant data entry
- Difficult maintenance
- Poor user experience

**After:** All user data is centralized in SQLite with:
- Single source of truth
- Automatic data reuse
- Consistent data everywhere
- Better performance with caching
- Seamless migration from old storage
