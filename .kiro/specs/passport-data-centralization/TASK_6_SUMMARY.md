# Task 6: Enhance PersonalInfo Model - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully enhanced the PersonalInfo model with userId-based lookup methods to support centralized data access patterns.

## Completed Subtasks

### 6.1 Add userId-based lookup method ✅
**Implementation:**
- Added `getByUserId(userId)` static method as an explicit API for loading personal info by user ID
- Method delegates to existing `load(userId)` method for consistency
- Provides clearer intent when accessing personal info by user ID

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
/**
 * Get personal information by user ID
 * This is an alias for load() to provide a more explicit API
 * @param {string} userId - User ID
 * @returns {Promise<PersonalInfo>} - PersonalInfo instance
 */
static async getByUserId(userId) {
  return await PersonalInfo.load(userId);
}
```

**Tests Added:**
- Test loading personal info by userId
- Test returning null when no data exists
- Test error handling when storage service fails
- Test equivalence with load() method

### 6.2 Add merge update method ✅
**Status:** Already completed in previous task

## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 7.3 ✅
"WHEN a user navigates to any entry form THEN the system SHALL load personal information from the centralized table"
- The `getByUserId(userId)` method loads personal information from the centralized SQLite table via `SecureStorageService.getPersonalInfo(userId)`

### Requirement 7.4 ✅
"WHEN a user updates personal information in the Profile screen THEN the system SHALL update the centralized table and reflect changes in all entry forms"
- The `load()` method already supports userId parameter
- The `getByUserId()` method provides an explicit API for this functionality
- Combined with existing `save()` and `update()` methods, ensures data consistency across screens

## Technical Details

### API Design
The `getByUserId()` method follows the design pattern established in the design document:
- Provides explicit, intention-revealing method name
- Maintains consistency with existing `load()` implementation
- Returns null when no data exists (graceful handling)
- Throws errors for storage failures (proper error propagation)

### Integration Points
- **SecureStorageService**: Uses `getPersonalInfo(userId)` for data retrieval
- **PassportDataService**: Can use `getByUserId()` for clearer code intent
- **Screen Components**: Provides explicit API for loading user personal info

## Files Modified
1. `app/models/PersonalInfo.js` - Added `getByUserId()` method
2. `app/models/__tests__/PersonalInfo.test.js` - Added comprehensive tests

## Testing
- Added 4 new test cases for `getByUserId()` method
- All tests verify correct behavior and error handling
- Tests confirm equivalence with existing `load()` method
- No syntax errors detected via diagnostics

## Next Steps
The PersonalInfo model is now fully enhanced and ready for use in:
- Task 8: Update ProfileScreen
- Task 9: Add data consistency validation
- Any future screens that need to load personal information

## Notes
- The `load()` method already supported userId parameter, so `getByUserId()` serves as an explicit alias
- This design choice maintains backward compatibility while providing clearer API semantics
- The implementation is minimal and delegates to existing tested code
