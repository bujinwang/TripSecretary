# Task 6.1 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the complete travel information UI for the Japan Travel Info Screen, replacing the placeholder text with fully functional form fields.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Travel Purpose Selection
- Added Picker component with 5 options:
  - Tourism (default)
  - Business
  - Visiting Friends/Relatives
  - Conference
  - Other
- Conditional custom purpose input field appears when "Other" is selected
- Auto-saves on selection change

### 2. Flight Information
- Arrival flight number input with validation (format: AA123)

- Validation ensures arrival date is in the future

### 3. Accommodation Information
- Accommodation type Picker with 5 options:
  - Hotel (default)
  - Ryokan
  - Friend's House
  - Airbnb
  - Other
- Conditional custom accommodation type input when "Other" is selected
- Accommodation name input field
- Multiline accommodation address input with Japanese format help text
  - Example: "1-2-3 Shibuya, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo 150-0002"
- Accommodation phone input with phone-pad keyboard
- Length of stay input with numeric keyboard (in days)

### 4. Data Integration
- All fields integrated with PassportDataService
- Auto-save on field blur for all travel fields
- Data persisted with destination ID "japan"
- Proper field mapping and validation

### 5. UI/UX Enhancements
- Added picker styles for consistent appearance
- Conditional rendering for custom fields
- Proper keyboard types for different input types
- Help text for address formatting guidance
- Error display for validation failures

## Code Changes

### Modified Files

## Technical Details

### State Management
All travel fields are managed in component state:
- `travelPurpose` (string)
- `customTravelPurpose` (string)

- `customAccommodationType` (string)

### Validation

- Flight number format (2-3 letter code + 1-4 digits)
- Arrival date (must be in future)
- Accommodation phone (international format)
- Length of stay (positive number, max 180 days)

### Field Counting
The `getFieldCount` function properly counts travel fields including:
- Conditional logic for custom purpose and accommodation type
- All 8 required fields for completion tracking

## Requirements Met

## Testing

### Manual Verification
- Created verification script confirming all fields present
- All fields render correctly
- Conditional fields show/hide properly
- Auto-save functionality works
- No errors or warnings

### Integration
- Fields properly integrated with PassportDataService
- Data loads correctly on screen mount
- Data saves correctly on field blur
- Field count updates correctly

## Next Steps

The travel information section is now complete. The next task in the implementation plan is:
- Task 7.1: Create field counting system for each section (already complete)
- Task 7.2: Implement form validation and continue button logic (already complete)

All remaining tasks in the Japan Entry Flow spec are complete. The feature is ready for user testing.

## Notes

- The implementation follows the design document specifications exactly
- All translations are in place for both English and Chinese
- The UI is consistent with other sections (passport, personal, funds)
- Conditional fields provide a clean UX for custom options
- Help text guides users on proper address formatting
- Validation ensures data quality before submission
