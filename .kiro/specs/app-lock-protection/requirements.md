# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds local device-based authentication to protect the app from unauthorized access when someone has physical access to the phone. Since the app currently has no registration or account system, the protection will use the device's built-in biometric authentication (fingerprint, Face ID) or a PIN/passcode as a fallback. This ensures that sensitive travel information, passport data, and generated arrival cards remain private even if the device is accessed by others.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: App Launch Protection

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to require authentication when I open it, so that my travel information remains private if someone else accesses my phone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is launched from a closed state THEN the system SHALL display an authentication screen before showing any app content
2. WHEN the app returns from background after being inactive for more than 2 minutes THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication
3. WHEN the app is in the foreground and actively being used THEN the system SHALL NOT interrupt with authentication prompts
4. IF the device supports biometric authentication (Face ID, Touch ID, fingerprint) THEN the system SHALL offer biometric authentication as the primary method
5. IF biometric authentication is not available or fails THEN the system SHALL offer PIN/passcode authentication as a fallback

### Requirement 2: First-Time Setup

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to set up app protection on first launch, so that I can choose my preferred security method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is launched for the first time THEN the system SHALL present an optional security setup screen
2. WHEN the user chooses to enable protection THEN the system SHALL guide them through setting up their preferred authentication method
3. IF the user skips security setup THEN the system SHALL allow them to enable it later from settings
4. WHEN the user enables biometric authentication THEN the system SHALL verify that device biometrics are configured
5. IF device biometrics are not configured THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to set up a PIN instead

### Requirement 3: Authentication Methods

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use my device's biometric authentication or a PIN, so that I can unlock the app quickly and securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN biometric authentication is triggered THEN the system SHALL use the device's native biometric prompt (Face ID, Touch ID, or fingerprint)
2. WHEN the user fails biometric authentication 3 times THEN the system SHALL fall back to PIN entry
3. WHEN PIN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL display a numeric keypad for 4-6 digit PIN entry
4. WHEN the user enters an incorrect PIN 3 times THEN the system SHALL implement a 30-second lockout period
5. WHEN the user enters an incorrect PIN 5 times THEN the system SHALL implement a 5-minute lockout period

### Requirement 4: Settings Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my app lock settings, so that I can enable, disable, or change my authentication preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to app settings THEN the system SHALL display an "App Lock" or "Security" section
2. WHEN the user wants to change security settings THEN the system SHALL require current authentication before allowing changes
3. WHEN the user disables app lock THEN the system SHALL require authentication confirmation
4. WHEN the user changes their PIN THEN the system SHALL require the old PIN before setting a new one
5. IF the user forgets their PIN THEN the system SHALL provide an option to reset app data and start fresh

### Requirement 5: Timeout Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure how long the app can be in the background before requiring re-authentication, so that I can balance security with convenience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses timeout settings THEN the system SHALL offer options: Immediate, 1 minute, 2 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, Never
2. WHEN the app goes to background THEN the system SHALL record the timestamp
3. WHEN the app returns to foreground THEN the system SHALL compare elapsed time against the configured timeout
4. IF elapsed time exceeds the timeout threshold THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication
5. WHEN timeout is set to "Never" THEN the system SHALL only require authentication on app launch from closed state

### Requirement 6: Data Protection

**User Story:** As a user, I want my sensitive data to be hidden when the app is locked, so that no information is visible in the app switcher or on the lock screen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app goes to background THEN the system SHALL display a privacy screen overlay hiding app content
2. WHEN the app appears in the iOS/Android app switcher THEN the system SHALL show only the privacy screen, not actual content
3. WHEN the app is locked THEN the system SHALL prevent screenshots of sensitive screens
4. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL remove the privacy overlay and restore normal functionality
5. IF the app receives a notification while locked THEN the system SHALL NOT display sensitive information in the notification

### Requirement 7: Accessibility and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the authentication process to be accessible, so that I can use the app regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the authentication screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL support screen readers and voice-over features
2. WHEN the user has large text enabled THEN the system SHALL scale authentication UI appropriately
3. WHEN biometric authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and alternative options
4. WHEN the app is locked THEN the system SHALL display a friendly message explaining why authentication is required
5. IF the user is elderly or has accessibility needs THEN the system SHALL support larger touch targets and clear visual feedback

### Requirement 8: Emergency Access

**User Story:** As a user, I want a way to access the app in an emergency even if I forget my PIN, so that I'm not completely locked out during critical travel situations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user fails authentication multiple times THEN the system SHALL display an "Emergency Access" or "Reset" option
2. WHEN the user chooses emergency access THEN the system SHALL warn that all locally stored data will be cleared
3. WHEN the user confirms emergency reset THEN the system SHALL clear all app data and authentication settings
4. WHEN emergency reset is complete THEN the system SHALL restart the app as if it's a fresh installation
5. IF the user has enabled device biometrics THEN the system SHALL always allow biometric authentication as an alternative to PIN
