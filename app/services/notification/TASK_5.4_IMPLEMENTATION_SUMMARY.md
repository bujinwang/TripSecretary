# Task 5.4 Implementation Summary: Window Open Notifications

## Overview

Successfully implemented the window open notification system that schedules notifications 7 days before arrival date, automatically cancels them when TDAC is submitted, and provides navigation to ThailandEntryFlowScreen on notification click.

## Requirements Addressed

- **16.1**: Send notification 7 days before arrival date: "You can now submit your Thailand entry card"
- **16.2**: Schedule notification when user sets arrival date, navigate to ThailandEntryFlowScreen on notification click, auto-cancel notification if already submitted

   - Tests core logic without Expo dependencies
   - Validates storage, date calculations, and filtering logic

### Files Modified

1. **`app/services/data/PassportDataService.js`**
   - Added `handleArrivalDateChange()` method
   - Modified `updateTravelInfo()` to detect arrival date changes
   - Integrated with NotificationCoordinator for automatic scheduling

2. **`app/services/entryPack/EntryPackService.js`**
   - Added `autoCancelWindowOpenNotification()` method
   - Modified `createOrUpdatePack()` to auto-cancel notifications on TDAC submission
   - Integrated with NotificationCoordinator

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Notification Scheduling
- **7-Day Advance Notice**: Automatically calculates and schedules notifications 7 days before arrival date
- **Smart Date Validation**: Prevents scheduling notifications for past dates
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Cancels existing notifications before scheduling new ones
- **Storage Management**: Persists notification mappings in AsyncStorage

### 2. Arrival Date Change Handling
- **Automatic Rescheduling**: Detects arrival date changes in travel info updates
- **Old Notification Cleanup**: Cancels previous notifications when dates change
- **New Notification Scheduling**: Schedules new notifications for updated dates
- **Null Date Handling**: Properly handles cases where arrival date is removed

### 3. TDAC Submission Auto-Cancel
- **Submission Detection**: Monitors TDAC submissions with valid arrCardNo
- **Automatic Cancellation**: Cancels window open notifications when TDAC is submitted
- **Validation Logic**: Ensures TDAC submission is valid before cancelling
- **Integration Points**: Works with EntryPackService state transitions

### 4. Notification Management
- **User-Specific Filtering**: Gets notifications for specific users
- **Expiry Detection**: Identifies and cleans up expired notifications
- **Consistency Validation**: Validates stored vs system notifications
- **Statistics Reporting**: Provides comprehensive usage statistics

### 5. Deep Link Navigation
- **ThailandEntryFlowScreen Navigation**: Notifications include deep links to entry flow screen
- **Entry Pack Context**: Passes entryPackId for proper context
- **User Context**: Includes userId for user-specific navigation

## Technical Implementation Details

### Notification Storage Structure
```javascript
{
  "windowOpenNotifications": {
    "entryPackId": {
      "notificationId": "system_notification_id",
      "userId": "user_id",
      "destination": "Thailand",
      "arrivalDate": "2024-12-01T10:00:00Z",
      "notificationDate": "2024-11-24T10:00:00Z",
      "scheduledAt": "2024-10-20T15:30:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

### Integration Points

1. **PassportDataService.updateTravelInfo()**
   - Detects arrival date changes
   - Calls NotificationCoordinator.handleArrivalDateChange()

2. **EntryPackService.createOrUpdatePack()**
   - Detects TDAC submission success
   - Calls NotificationCoordinator.autoCancelIfSubmitted()

3. **NotificationTemplateService**
   - Uses existing template system for consistent messaging
   - Leverages SUBMISSION_WINDOW_OPEN template type

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Notification failures don't break main app flow
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Validation**: Input validation for dates, user IDs, and submission data
- **Recovery**: Consistency validation and cleanup mechanisms

## Testing

### Integration Tests
- ✅ Notification storage management
- ✅ Date calculation logic (7 days before arrival)
- ✅ Notification filtering by user
- ✅ Expiry detection and cleanup
- ✅ TDAC submission validation
- ✅ Consistency validation logic

### Test Coverage
- Storage operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Date calculations and validations
- User filtering and sorting
- Expiry detection algorithms
- TDAC submission validation
- System consistency checks

## Usage Examples

### Basic Scheduling
```javascript
import NotificationCoordinator from './NotificationCoordinator';

// Schedule notification when user sets arrival date
const notificationId = await NotificationCoordinator.scheduleWindowOpenNotification(
  userId,
  entryPackId,
  new Date('2024-12-01T10:00:00Z'),
  'Thailand'
);
```

### Arrival Date Change
```javascript
// Handle arrival date change (automatically reschedules)
await NotificationCoordinator.handleArrivalDateChange(
  userId,
  entryPackId,
  newArrivalDate,
  oldArrivalDate,
  'Thailand'
);
```

### Auto-Cancel on Submission
```javascript
// Auto-cancel when TDAC is submitted
const cancelled = await NotificationCoordinator.autoCancelIfSubmitted(
  entryPackId,
  tdacSubmission
);
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Efficient Storage**: Uses Map-based in-memory caching with AsyncStorage persistence
- **Batch Operations**: Supports multiple notification operations efficiently
- **Lazy Loading**: Services initialize only when needed
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of expired data

## Security Considerations

- **User Isolation**: Notifications are properly filtered by user ID
- **Data Validation**: All inputs are validated before processing
- **Secure Storage**: Uses existing SecureStorageService patterns
- **No Sensitive Data**: Notification content doesn't include sensitive information

## Future Enhancements

The implementation provides a solid foundation for future notification types:
- Urgent reminder notifications (Task 5.5)
- Deadline notifications (Task 5.6)
- Arrival reminder notifications (Task 5.7)
- Data change notifications (Task 5.9)

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Statistics Available
- Total scheduled notifications
- Active vs expired notifications
- User-specific notification counts
- System consistency status

### Debugging Tools
- Comprehensive logging throughout the system
- Validation methods for consistency checking
- Example usage patterns for testing
- Integration test suite for verification

## Conclusion

Task 5.4 has been successfully implemented with a robust, scalable notification system that:
- ✅ Schedules notifications 7 days before arrival date
- ✅ Automatically cancels notifications when TDAC is submitted
- ✅ Handles arrival date changes gracefully
- ✅ Provides navigation to ThailandEntryFlowScreen
- ✅ Includes comprehensive testing and examples
- ✅ Integrates seamlessly with existing services
- ✅ Follows established patterns and best practices

The implementation is ready for production use and provides a solid foundation for the remaining notification tasks in Phase 5.
