# Task 9.3 Implementation Summary: Snapshot Creation and Management

## Overview
Successfully implemented the integration between EntryPackService and SnapshotService for automatic snapshot creation and management during entry pack lifecycle transitions.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Automatic Snapshot Creation on State Transitions

**EntryPackService Integration:**
- Added snapshot creation hooks to the `transitionState` method
- Integrated with all relevant state transitions:
  - `submitted`: Creates snapshot when TDAC is successfully submitted
  - `completed`: Creates snapshot when user marks entry pack as completed
  - `expired`: Creates snapshot when entry pack expires automatically
  - `archived`: Creates snapshot on archival (if none exists)

**Snapshot Creation Methods:**
- `createSnapshotOnSubmission()`: Creates snapshot with TDAC submission metadata
- `createSnapshotOnCompletion()`: Creates snapshot with completion metadata
- `createSnapshotOnExpiry()`: Creates snapshot with expiry metadata
- `createSnapshotOnArchival()`: Creates snapshot on archival (checks for existing snapshots)

### 2. Photo Copying to Snapshot Storage

**SnapshotService Enhancements:**
- Enhanced `copyPhotosToSnapshotStorage()` method to handle fund item photos
- Implements proper naming convention: `snapshot_{snapshotId}_{fundItemId}_{timestamp}.jpg`
- Creates dedicated snapshot storage directories
- Handles missing photos gracefully with placeholder entries
- Validates photo files before copying (size, existence, readability)

**Photo Management Features:**
- Copies all fund proof photos to isolated snapshot storage
- Maintains photo manifest with metadata (original path, snapshot path, file size, status)
- Handles photo copy failures gracefully without breaking snapshot creation
- Supports photo encryption (when encryption service is available)

### 3. Snapshot Deletion and Cleanup

**Entry Pack Deletion Integration:**
- Updated EntryPack model's `delete()` method to trigger snapshot cleanup
- Added `handleSnapshotCleanupOnDeletion()` method to EntryPackService
- Automatically finds and deletes all snapshots associated with deleted entry pack
- Handles partial deletion failures gracefully

**Cleanup Features:**
- Deletes snapshot records and associated photo directories
- Provides cleanup statistics (total snapshots, successfully deleted)
- Logs cleanup operations for audit trail
- Continues cleanup even if individual snapshot deletions fail

### 4. Enhanced Filtering and Retrieval

**EntryPackSnapshot Model:**
- Added `entryPackId` filter to `loadByUserId()` method
- Supports filtering snapshots by specific entry pack

**EntryPackService Methods:**
- `getSnapshotsForEntryPack()`: Retrieves all snapshots for a specific entry pack
- `hasSnapshots()`: Checks if an entry pack has any associated snapshots
- Integrates with SnapshotService filtering capabilities

### 5. Error Handling and Resilience

**Graceful Error Handling:**
- Snapshot creation failures don't break main entry pack operations
- Photo copying failures are logged but don't prevent snapshot creation
- Cleanup failures are handled gracefully with partial success reporting
- All snapshot operations are non-blocking to main application flow

**Logging and Monitoring:**
- Comprehensive logging for all snapshot operations
- Error logging with context information
- Success/failure statistics for cleanup operations
- Audit trail for snapshot lifecycle events

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Transition Integration
```javascript
// In EntryPackService.transitionState()
switch (newState) {
  case 'submitted':
    if (options.tdacSubmission) {
      entryPack.updateTDACSubmission(options.tdacSubmission, options.submissionMethod);
    }
    // Create snapshot on TDAC submission
    await this.createSnapshotOnSubmission(entryPack, options);
    break;
    
  case 'completed':
    // Entry pack completed - create snapshot
    await this.createSnapshotOnCompletion(entryPack, options);
    break;
    
  // ... other states
}
```

### Photo Copying Implementation
```javascript
// Enhanced photo copying with error handling
for (const fund of funds) {
  if (fund.photoUri) {
    try {
      const originalInfo = await FileSystem.getInfoAsync(fund.photoUri);
      if (originalInfo.exists && originalInfo.size > 0) {
        await FileSystem.copyAsync({
          from: fund.photoUri,
          to: snapshotPhotoPath
        });
        // Add success entry to manifest
      } else {
        // Add missing photo placeholder
      }
    } catch (error) {
      // Add failed photo entry to manifest
    }
  }
}
```

### Cleanup Integration
```javascript
// In EntryPack.delete()
async delete() {
  // Handle snapshot cleanup before deleting entry pack
  const snapshotCleanup = await EntryPackService.handleSnapshotCleanupOnDeletion(this.id, this.userId);
  
  const result = await SecureStorageService.deleteEntryPack(this.id);
  
  return {
    ...result,
    snapshotCleanup: snapshotCleanup
  };
}
```
