# Currency Change Feature - Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Currency Picker Display
- **Issue**: Currency picker modal was opening but not showing the list of currencies
- **Fix**: 
  - Changed `currencyPickerContent` height from `maxHeight: '60%'` to `height: '60%'`
  - Added `minHeight: 200` to `currencyPickerList` for proper ScrollView rendering
  - Fixed currencies array using Unicode escape sequences for special symbols

### 2. Fixed Save Functionality for BANK_BALANCE Type
- **Issue**: Save button wasn't working for BANK_BALANCE items
- **Root Cause**: Validation and save logic only checked for 'CASH', 'BANK_CARD', 'cash', 'credit_card' but missed 'BANK_BALANCE'
- **Fix**: 
  - Updated validation check to use `isAmountBasedType()` helper function
  - Updated `shouldUpdateAmount` logic to use `isAmountBasedType()` consistently
  - Added better logging for debugging

### 3. Improved UX - Direct Field Editing
- **Change**: Made fields directly tappable without needing to click "Edit" button first
- **Implementation**:
  - Converted amount, currency, and description displays to `TouchableOpacity` components
  - Tapping any field automatically switches to edit mode
  - Added visual styling (`tappableSection`) with background color and border to indicate fields are interactive
  - Added `activeOpacity={0.7}` for better touch feedback

### 4. Simplified Button Layout
- **View Mode**: 
  - Removed "Edit" button (no longer needed since fields are directly tappable)
  - Kept "Delete" button at the bottom
- **Edit Mode**: 
  - "Save Changes" button (primary action)
  - "Cancel" button (secondary action)
  - Back arrow in header also cancels edit mode
