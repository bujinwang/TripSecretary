# Travel Info Persistence Implementation

## Overview
Implemented database persistence for travel information (flights, hotels) in the ThailandTravelInfoScreen. Users can now fill in travel details progressively and resume where they left off.

## Problem Solved
Previously, travel info was only stored in React state and passed via navigation params. If users navigated away or the app restarted, all travel info was lost. This was frustrating for users filling out lengthy forms.

## Solution Architecture

### 1. New TravelInfo Model (`app/models/TravelInfo.js`)
Created a dedicated model for trip-specific travel information:

**Fields:**
- Arrival flight: flight number, departure/arrival airports, dates, times
- Departure flight: flight number, departure/arrival airports, dates, times
- Accommodation: hotel name and address
- Metadata: destination, status (draft/completed), timestamps

**Key Features:**
- Progressive validation (validates format of provided fields only)
- Completion tracking (percentage and status)
- Merge updates pattern (doesn't overwrite existing data with empty values)
- Format validation for flight numbers, dates, and times

### 2. Database Schema
Added `travel_info` table to SQLite database:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS travel_info (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT,
  destination TEXT,
  arrival_flight_number TEXT,
  arrival_departure_airport TEXT,
  arrival_departure_date TEXT,
  arrival_departure_time TEXT,
  arrival_arrival_airport TEXT,
  arrival_arrival_date TEXT,
  arrival_arrival_time TEXT,
  departure_flight_number TEXT,
  departure_departure_airport TEXT,
  departure_departure_date TEXT,
  departure_departure_time TEXT,
  departure_arrival_airport TEXT,
  departure_arrival_date TEXT,
  departure_arrival_time TEXT,
  hotel_name TEXT,
  hotel_address TEXT,
  status TEXT,
  created_at TEXT,
  updated_at TEXT
)
```

**Indexes:**
- `idx_travel_info_user_id` - Fast lookup by user
- `idx_travel_info_destination` - Fast lookup by user + destination

### 3. SecureStorageService Methods
Added two new methods:

**`saveTravelInfo(travelData)`**
- Saves or updates travel info using `INSERT OR REPLACE`
- Handles all 16+ travel info fields
- Logs audit trail

**`getTravelInfo(userId, destination)`**
- Retrieves most recent travel info for user
- Optional destination filter (e.g., 'Thailand')
- Returns null if no data found

### 4. PassportDataService Methods
Added three new methods for unified data access:

**`getTravelInfo(userId, destination)`**
- Loads travel info from database
- No caching (draft data changes frequently)

**`saveTravelInfo(userId, travelData)`**
- Filters out empty fields before saving
- Merges with existing data if present
- Creates new record if none exists

**`updateTravelInfo(userId, destination, updates)`**
- Updates specific fields without overwriting others
- Uses merge pattern for progressive filling

### 5. ThailandTravelInfoScreen Integration

**Data Loading:**
- Added travel info loading in `loadSavedData()` useEffect
- Loads saved travel info for the destination
- Populates all 16 travel info fields from database

**Data Saving:**
- Extended `saveDataToSecureStorage()` to save travel info
- Filters out empty fields (same pattern as personal info)
- Auto-saves on field blur and date/time changes
- Logs save operations for debugging

## Key Design Patterns

### Progressive Data Filling
Users can fill fields incrementally without losing data:
1. Fill in arrival flight number → saves
2. Navigate away and come back → arrival flight number still there
3. Fill in hotel name → saves, flight number preserved
4. Continue filling → all previous data preserved

### Merge Updates Pattern
```javascript
// Only include non-empty fields
const travelInfoUpdates = {};
if (arrivalFlightNumber && arrivalFlightNumber.trim()) {
  travelInfoUpdates.arrivalFlightNumber = arrivalFlightNumber;
}
// ... repeat for all fields

// Save only non-empty updates
await PassportDataService.saveTravelInfo(userId, travelInfoUpdates);
```

This ensures:
- Empty fields don't overwrite existing data
- Users can fill fields in any order
- Data persists across sessions

### Destination-Specific Storage
Travel info is stored per destination:
- Thailand trip → separate record
- Japan trip → separate record
- Users can have multiple draft trips

## Files Modified

1. **app/models/TravelInfo.js** (NEW)
   - Complete travel info model with validation
   - Merge updates support
   - Completion tracking

2. **app/services/security/SecureStorageService.js**
   - Added `travel_info` table schema
   - Added `saveTravelInfo()` method
   - Added `getTravelInfo()` method
   - Added indexes for performance

3. **app/services/data/PassportDataService.js**
   - Added `getTravelInfo()` method
   - Added `saveTravelInfo()` method
   - Added `updateTravelInfo()` method
   - Added TRAVEL INFO OPERATIONS section

4. **app/screens/thailand/ThailandTravelInfoScreen.js**
   - Added travel info loading in useEffect
   - Extended `saveDataToSecureStorage()` to save travel info
   - Added logging for debugging

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Persistence
- [ ] Fill in arrival flight number, navigate away, come back → data persists
- [ ] Fill in hotel name, navigate away, come back → data persists
- [ ] Fill in multiple fields, navigate away, come back → all data persists

### Progressive Filling
- [ ] Fill in arrival flight → saves
- [ ] Add departure flight → both persist
- [ ] Add hotel → all three persist
- [ ] Fields can be filled in any order

### Data Integrity
- [ ] Empty fields don't overwrite existing data
- [ ] Partial updates preserve other fields
- [ ] Date and time fields save correctly
- [ ] Special characters in airport names save correctly

### Multi-Destination
- [ ] Thailand travel info saves separately
- [ ] Can have multiple destination drafts
- [ ] Correct data loads for each destination

### Edge Cases
- [ ] App restart → data persists
- [ ] Screen reload → data persists
- [ ] Navigation back and forth → data persists
- [ ] Very long hotel addresses save correctly

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**
   - Users don't lose their work
   - Can fill form over multiple sessions
   - Reduces frustration and form abandonment

2. **Data Consistency**
   - All data stored in centralized database
   - Same patterns as passport and personal info
   - Consistent merge update behavior

3. **Performance**
   - Indexed queries for fast lookup
   - No unnecessary re-renders
   - Efficient auto-save with debouncing

4. **Maintainability**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Reusable patterns across models
   - Well-documented code

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multiple Trips**
   - List of saved trips per destination
   - Select which trip to edit
   - Archive completed trips

2. **Auto-fill from Previous Trips**
   - Suggest airports from travel history
   - Pre-fill hotel if same as last time
   - Smart defaults based on patterns

3. **Validation Improvements**
   - Real-time flight number validation
   - Airport code validation
   - Date logic validation (departure after arrival)

4. **Sync Across Devices**
   - Cloud backup of travel info
   - Sync between user's devices
   - Conflict resolution

## Migration Notes

- **Automatic**: New table created on app startup
- **No data loss**: Existing users get empty travel info (expected)
- **Backward compatible**: Old code paths still work
- **Database version**: No version bump needed (additive change)

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal**: One additional table with indexes
- **Fast queries**: Indexed by user_id and destination
- **No caching**: Draft data doesn't benefit from caching
- **Efficient saves**: Only non-empty fields saved

## Security Considerations

- **Non-sensitive data**: Travel info is not encrypted (flight numbers, airports are public)
- **User-scoped**: All queries filtered by user_id
- **Audit trail**: All saves logged in audit_log table
- **Local storage**: Data stays on device (no cloud sync yet)
