# Tab Order Fix - Person Data Section

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Tab Order Issue
Users had to close the edit modal and manually tap each field to edit personal information, making data entry slow and tedious.

### 2. Gender Not Saving
Gender selection buttons were calling a debounced auto-save function meant for text input, causing delays and confusion.

### 3. Name Field Reverting to Surname Only
The passport name was stored as "ZHANG WEI" instead of "ZHANG, WEI" (comma-separated format), causing the PassportNameInput component to only show the surname after navigation.

### 4. Date of Birth Validation
No validation was performed on date of birth input, allowing invalid dates like 1988-01-01 (which should be validated for proper month/day ranges).

### 5. Data Not Persisting (ProfileScreen)
Personal info and passport data were only stored in component state, causing data loss when the screen reloaded or navigated away.

### 6. Gender Not Showing in Thailand Screen
In ThailandTravelInfoScreen, gender selection buttons were not highlighted because the `sex` state was initialized to empty string when passport data didn't include a `sex` field.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Field Navigation
- Modified `handleStartEdit()` to accept and track a `fieldIndex` parameter
- Added `handleNavigateField(direction)` function that saves and navigates between fields
- Added "Previous" and "Next" buttons in the modal (disabled at boundaries)
- Added keyboard integration with `returnKeyType` and `onSubmitEditing`

### 2. Gender Selection Fix
- Created dedicated `handleGenderSelect()` function for immediate save
- Auto-closes modal after 0.5s to provide visual feedback
- No more debounce delay for button selections

### 3. Name Field Fix
- Changed passport name format from "ZHANG WEI" to "ZHANG, WEI" (comma-separated)
- Made name field editable in passport section
- Integrated PassportNameInput component in the edit modal
- Added 'passport-name' type handling in save/edit functions

### 4. Date of Birth Validation
- Added comprehensive `validateDateOfBirth()` function that checks:
  - Correct format (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Valid year range (1900 to current year)
  - Valid month (01-12)
  - Valid day for the specific month (handles leap years)
  - Date is not in the future
  - Person is not unreasonably old (max 150 years)
- Real-time validation with error messages displayed below input
- Red border on input field when validation fails
- Prevents navigation to next field if date is invalid
- Shows helpful hint text with example format
- Only saves valid dates

### 5. Data Persistence (ProfileScreen)
- Integrated SecureStorageService to persist data across sessions
- Added useEffect hooks to:
  - Load saved personalInfo and passportData on component mount
  - Auto-save personalInfo whenever it changes
  - Auto-save passportData whenever it changes
- Data now survives screen reloads and navigation
- Added console logging for debugging save/load operations
- Added "Clear Saved Data" button for debugging

### 6. Thailand Screen Gender Fix
- Set default value for `sex` state to 'Male' instead of empty string
- Updated data loading logic to use same default
- Added comprehensive console logging for debugging
- Gender buttons now show correct selection on initial load

## User Experience Improvements
Users can now:
1. Tap a field to start editing
2. Use "Next" button or keyboard to move to the next field
3. Use "Previous" button to go back
4. Press "Done" to finish editing
5. Gender selection saves immediately and closes the modal
6. Name field properly maintains both surname and given name through navigation
7. Date of birth validation provides immediate feedback with clear error messages
8. Invalid dates are prevented from being saved
9. Helpful format hints guide users to enter dates correctly
10. All data persists across screen reloads and app restarts
11. Gender selection is properly saved and displayed when reopening the modal

This significantly improves data entry speed, reduces errors, provides data persistence, and delivers a more polished user experience.
