## Priority 1: Singapore (3,153 lines, 48 useState) 🔴

### Current State
- **File size**: 3,153 lines (largest after Thailand)
- **useState count**: 48 declarations (similar to Thailand's 57)
- **Sections**: Passport, Personal, Funds, Travel
- **Features**: DebouncedSave, SoftValidation, EntryCompletionCalculator
- **Structure**: Monolithic, all logic in one file

### Why Priority 1?
- ✅ **Largest file** (3,153 lines) - most benefit from refactoring
- ✅ **Most useState** (48) - complex state management
- ✅ **Most similar to Thailand** - can directly apply proven methodology
- ✅ **High complexity** - hardest to maintain as-is

### Expected Outcome
- Main file: 3,153 → ~1,900 lines (-40%)
- Custom hooks: ~1,200 lines
- Section components: ~1,100 lines
- Styles file: ~500 lines

### Refactoring Plan
```
Phase 1: Custom Hooks Extraction
├── useSingaporeFormState.js (~380 lines)
├── useSingaporeDataPersistence.js (~450 lines)
└── useSingaporeValidation.js (~350 lines)

Phase 2: Section Components
├── SingaporeHeroSection.js (~120 lines)
├── PassportSection.js (~300 lines)
├── PersonalInfoSection.js (~200 lines)
├── FundsSection.js (~200 lines)
└── TravelDetailsSection.js (~280 lines)

Phase 3: Integration
├── Phase 3a: Imports + hook initialization
├── Phase 3b: Replace data loading & update handlers
└── Phase 3c: Replace JSX sections

Phase 4: Styles Extraction
└── SingaporeTravelInfoScreen.styles.js (~500 lines)

Phase 5 (Optional): Break down large sections
└── If any section > 500 lines
```

### Estimated Effort
- **Time**: 3-4 hours
- **Risk**: Low (proven methodology from Thailand)
- **Benefit**: High (40% reduction, better maintainability)

---

## Priority 2: Malaysia (1,474 lines, 30 useState) 🟡

### Current State
- **File size**: 1,474 lines (moderate)
- **useState count**: 30 declarations
- **Sections**: Passport, Personal, Travel (no Funds per MALAYSIA_REFACTOR_STATUS.md)
- **Features**: UserInteractionTracker, FieldStateManager, DebouncedSave (already added)
- **Structure**: Monolithic, but has some modern features

### Why Priority 2?
- ✅ **Moderate size** (1,474 lines) - manageable but could be better
- ✅ **Already has some features** - but still monolithic structure
- ✅ **Moderate useState** (30) - less complex than Singapore
- ⚠️ **Different from Thailand** - no funds section (MDAC doesn't require)

### Expected Outcome
- Main file: 1,474 → ~900 lines (-39%)
- Custom hooks: ~750 lines
- Section components: ~700 lines
- Styles file: ~350 lines

### Refactoring Plan
```
Phase 1: Custom Hooks Extraction
├── useMalaysiaFormState.js (~300 lines)
├── useMalaysiaDataPersistence.js (~300 lines)
└── useMalaysiaValidation.js (~250 lines)

Phase 2: Section Components
├── MalaysiaHeroSection.js (~120 lines)
├── PassportSection.js (~250 lines)
├── PersonalInfoSection.js (~180 lines)
└── TravelDetailsSection.js (~250 lines)

Phase 3: Integration
├── Phase 3a: Imports + hook initialization
├── Phase 3b: Replace data loading & update handlers
└── Phase 3c: Replace JSX sections

Phase 4: Styles Extraction
└── MalaysiaTravelInfoScreen.styles.js (~350 lines)

Phase 5 (Optional): Break down large sections
└── Likely not needed (no section > 500 lines)
```

### Estimated Effort
- **Time**: 2-3 hours
- **Risk**: Low (similar to Thailand, fewer sections)
- **Benefit**: Medium (39% reduction, consistency with Thailand)

### Special Considerations
- No funds section (MDAC doesn't require proof of funds)
- Already has UserInteractionTracker and FieldStateManager
- Can extract these utilities into hooks for better organization

---

## Priority 3: Korea (988 lines, 45 useState) 🟢

### Current State
- **File size**: 988 lines (smallest file)
- **useState count**: 45 declarations (surprisingly high for file size!)
- **Sections**: Unknown (needs analysis)
- **Features**: Unknown (needs analysis)
- **Structure**: Likely monolithic with high state complexity

### Why Priority 3?
- ⚠️ **Smallest file** (988 lines) - but has many useState (45)
- ✅ **High useState density** - 45 useState in 988 lines = complex state management
- ✅ **Would benefit from refactoring** - state consolidation needed
- ⚠️ **Unknown structure** - needs more analysis

### Expected Outcome
- Main file: 988 → ~600 lines (-39%)
- Custom hooks: ~650 lines
- Section components: ~500 lines
- Styles file: ~250 lines

### Refactoring Plan
```
Phase 1: Custom Hooks Extraction (PRIORITY)
├── useKoreaFormState.js (~250 lines) - consolidate 45 useState!
├── useKoreaDataPersistence.js (~250 lines)
└── useKoreaValidation.js (~200 lines)

Phase 2: Section Components
├── KoreaHeroSection.js (~100 lines)
├── PassportSection.js (~200 lines)
├── PersonalInfoSection.js (~150 lines)
└── TravelDetailsSection.js (~200 lines)

Phase 3: Integration
├── Phase 3a: Imports + hook initialization
├── Phase 3b: Replace data loading & update handlers
└── Phase 3c: Replace JSX sections

Phase 4: Styles Extraction
└── KoreaTravelInfoScreen.styles.js (~250 lines)

Phase 5 (Optional): Break down large sections
└── Likely not needed
```

### Estimated Effort
- **Time**: 2-3 hours
- **Risk**: Medium (unknown structure, needs analysis first)
- **Benefit**: High (state consolidation critical - 45 useState!)

### Special Considerations
- **High useState density** suggests complex state management
- Phase 1 (custom hooks) will provide the most benefit
- May have unique Korean entry card requirements

---

## Priority 4: Japan (1,147 lines, 7 useState) 🔵

### Current State
- **File size**: 1,147 lines (moderate)
- **useState count**: 7 declarations (very low!)
- **Sections**: Unknown (needs analysis)
- **Features**: Unknown (needs analysis)
- **Structure**: Possibly already using hooks or simpler structure

### Why Priority 4 (Lowest)?
- ✅ **Very few useState** (7) - suggests good state management already
- ✅ **Moderate size** (1,147 lines)
- ⚠️ **May not need refactoring** - low useState suggests hooks or simpler design
- 🔵 **REVIEW FIRST** - analyze structure before deciding

### Analysis Needed
Before refactoring Japan, we should:
1. Read the file to understand structure
2. Check if already using custom hooks
3. Determine if 5-phase refactoring is beneficial
4. May just need Phase 4 (styles extraction) or Phase 2 (component extraction)

### Possible Scenarios

**Scenario A: Already Using Hooks**
- If Japan already uses custom hooks, skip Phase 1
- Only apply Phase 2 (components) and Phase 4 (styles)
- Estimated effort: 1-2 hours

**Scenario B: Simpler Form Structure**
- If Japan has fewer fields and simpler logic
- May only need Phase 4 (styles extraction)
- Estimated effort: 30 minutes

**Scenario C: Needs Full Refactoring**
- If Japan has complex inline logic despite low useState
- Apply all 5 phases
- Estimated effort: 2-3 hours

### Refactoring Plan (TBD after analysis)
```
Phase 0: Analysis & Decision
├── Read Japan screen structure
├── Check for existing custom hooks
├── Determine necessary phases
└── Create tailored refactoring plan

Phases 1-5: TBD based on analysis
```

### Estimated Effort
- **Time**: 0.5-3 hours (depends on analysis)
- **Risk**: Low (smallest scope)
- **Benefit**: Unknown (needs analysis)

## Risk Assessment

| Country | Technical Risk | Testing Risk | Integration Risk | Overall Risk |
|---------|---------------|--------------|------------------|--------------|
| Singapore | 🟢 LOW | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🟢 LOW | 🟢 LOW |
| Malaysia | 🟢 LOW | 🟢 LOW | 🟢 LOW | 🟢 LOW |
| Korea | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| Japan | 🔵 UNKNOWN | 🔵 UNKNOWN | 🟢 LOW | 🟡 MEDIUM |

**Risk Factors**:
- **Singapore**: Low risk - most similar to Thailand reference implementation
- **Malaysia**: Low risk - already has some features, fewer sections
- **Korea**: Medium risk - unknown structure, high useState density needs analysis
- **Japan**: Unknown risk - very low useState suggests different architecture

---

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
- ✅ **File size reduction**: Target 40-45% reduction in main file
- ✅ **useState consolidation**: Reduce from N useState to 1 hook
- ✅ **Code organization**: Logic (hooks) + UI (components) + Styles (separate)
- ✅ **Reusability**: Custom hooks can be reused in other contexts

### Qualitative Metrics
- ✅ **Developer experience**: Easier to find and modify specific functionality
- ✅ **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused files are easier to maintain
- ✅ **Testability**: Components and hooks can be tested in isolation
- ✅ **Consistency**: All country screens follow same architecture

## Expected Results Summary

### Before Refactoring
```
Thailand:   3,930 lines, 57 useState (DONE - now 2,274 lines)
Singapore:  3,153 lines, 48 useState
Malaysia:   1,474 lines, 30 useState
Korea:        988 lines, 45 useState
Japan:      1,147 lines,  7 useState
---
Total:      8,762 lines, 130 useState (excluding Thailand)
```

### After Refactoring (Estimated)
```
Thailand:   2,274 lines (✅ COMPLETE)
Singapore:  ~1,900 lines (-40%)
Malaysia:     ~900 lines (-39%)
Korea:        ~600 lines (-39%)
Japan:        ~700 lines (-39%) or less
---
Total:      ~4,100 lines (-53% reduction!)

Plus:
- 12 custom hooks (~3,600 lines of reusable logic)
- 16 section components (~2,800 lines of focused UI)
- 4 styles files (~1,400 lines of organized styles)
```

### Total Code Organization
```
Main Screens:     ~4,100 lines (down from 8,762)
Custom Hooks:     ~3,600 lines (extracted logic)
Components:       ~2,800 lines (extracted UI)
Styles:           ~1,400 lines (extracted styles)
---
Total:           ~11,900 lines (organized across ~32 files)

Net Change: +3,138 lines (+36%)
BUT: Much better organization, reusability, and maintainability!
```
