## Key Decisions Made

### 1. AI Provider: 通义千问 (Tongyi Qianwen) - Alibaba Cloud
**Why**: 
- Accessible in mainland China (OpenAI is blocked)
- Excellent Chinese language understanding
- 95% cheaper than OpenAI (¥0.008 vs $0.21 per 1K tokens)
- Fast response time in China
- Alibaba ecosystem integration

**Alternatives considered**:
- OpenAI GPT-4 (for international users only)
- 文心一言 ERNIE Bot (Baidu) - backup option
- ChatGLM (智谱AI) - budget option

### 2. MVP Uses Mock Booking APIs
**Why**: 
- Avoid API costs during development
- Focus on UX first
- Booking APIs integration is Phase 2

**Real APIs for later**:
- Amadeus (flights)
- Booking.com (hotels)
- Skyscanner (flight comparison)

### 3. Conversation Storage: AsyncStorage
**Why**: Simple, works offline, sufficient for MVP

**Future consideration**: 
- Cloud sync for multi-device
- Backend database for analytics

### 4. Intent Recognition: Pattern Matching
**Why**: Simple, works for MVP

**Future**: ML-based intent classification

## Resource Requirements

### Development
- **Time**: 8 weeks for MVP

### APIs & Services
- **通义千问 API**: ~¥50-200/month (~$7-28 USD, depending on usage)
- **Hosting**: Free (client-side for MVP)
- **Analytics**: Free tier (Firebase/Mixpanel)
- **Optional OpenAI**: For international users (~$50-200/month)

### Phase 2 (Real Booking)
- **Amadeus API**: Enterprise plan ($500-2000/month)

## Questions to Answer

1. **Budget**: What's the monthly budget for OpenAI API?
2. **Timeline**: When do we want MVP ready?
3. **Booking Partners**: Which APIs should we prioritize?
4. **Monetization**: Free tier vs paid from start?

6. **Support**: Human fallback needed?

## Documents Created

1. **AI_TRIP_ASSISTANT_DESIGN.md** - Comprehensive feature design
2. **AI_TRIP_ASSISTANT_MVP_SPEC.md** - Technical specification
3. **AI_TRIP_ASSISTANT_WIREFRAMES.md** - UI/UX mockups
4. **AI_TRIP_ASSISTANT_SUMMARY.md** - This document

## Recommendation

**Proceed with MVP development** using the phased approach:
- Start with Phase 1 (chat foundation)
- Use mock booking data initially
- Iterate based on user feedback
- Add real booking in Phase 2

The design is solid, technically feasible, and provides clear value to users. The MVP scope is achievable in 8 weeks with 1-2 developers.
